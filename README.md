### 🌍 About Me

Hi! I'm **Andhika Yudha**, a Frontend Developer with a strong passion for building modern, responsive, and interactive web applications using technologies like **React**, **Next.Js**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

I enjoy turning UI designs into clean and functional code, and I'm always looking for ways to improve user experience through thoughtful design and performance optimization.

Currently, I’m also learning **Backend Development** with tools like **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Supabase**, as I work toward becoming a **Full Stack Developer**.

🚀 Open to collaboration and always eager to learn new technologies!
